# Interactive JavaFX Study App with Quizzes

This project is an interactive study app designed to help students understand JavaFX concepts. The app features multiple scenes that guide users through various functionalities. It begins with a welcoming page featuring a "Get Started" icon. The app includes a search feature allowing users to check if their desired course is available. Upon locating the course, users can proceed, leading them to a page displaying chapters and a related quiz. Notably, users can navigate back to the courses pageâ€”an often-overlooked feature. The course chapters offer options for "Key Points" and "References," emphasizing familiarity with JavaFX rather than actual course content. The highlight of the app is the quiz section, where each course's quiz contains four timed questions. Correct answers are shown automatically after 10 seconds, and users progress through questions. The quiz culminates in a score out of four, providing an interactive and educational experience.



## How to Use

1. Cloning this repo would save all the files in a directory

2. Open **IntelliJ Idea** app and click on File -> New -> Project form Version Control -> And paste this link: https://github.com/Savitri-projects/Interactive_JavaFX_Study_App_with_Quizzes.git

3. Click on clone, you will be able to clone it into any directory you want.
**Note**: I've weird file/folder naming habit and I save executables (like javafx modules etc.,) in different locations - not on the default ones, so make sure you check all of those, when you get an error. Alternately I found [this](https://youtu.be/ZfaPMLdgJxQ) video and following the steps in this should cause no problems

4. Please install JavaFx modules from [here](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/#:~:text=GPL%20v2%20%2B%20Classpath-,Downloads,-JavaFX%20version), I would say.

5. src directory in the repository has a 'main' file. You should be good to run it.ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³



## Screenshots

1. Upon execution of 'main', this will be the first page that you would land in.

6. Each course has similar functionality

7. I put screenshots for 'Engineering Mathematics - IV'

8. Go back will take you to the courses page![First image](https://i.postimg.cc/Bb9SGby1/image.png)

9. Each 'Unit' takes you to this page: ![First image](https://i.postimg.cc/5tSqzQ5f/image.png)

10. Each 'Questions and Answers' creates a new quiz window like this: ![First image](https://i.postimg.cc/4dnwVbJp/image.png) -> You can experiment with it.

11. You can improve the project in many ways. This is a basic JavaFX project. 'Key points' and 'References' buttons take you to these pages:
